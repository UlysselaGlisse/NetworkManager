about=This Qgis plugin allows you to create routes between two points from a
    vector network. The most obvious example of a network is that of roads: department road 42 is both a single road and consists of dozens of different sections.

    The sections are segments in the plugin, while the department road corresponds to a composition. All geographical work is done on the segments. Compositions only have attributes and a list containing the identifiers of the segments.

    The first function of this plugin is to assist when dividing a segment. If the segment is part of one or more compositions, it can be cumbersome to find in which ones and at what location. The plugin takes care of this for you.

    This plugin can also help you keep your compositions correct by searching for potential errors.
    It can furthermore create the geometries of each from your compositions.

    Another tool, called the segment basket, allows you to directly select on the map the IDs of the segments that will make up your next road.
