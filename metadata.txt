about=
    This QGIS plugin will be useful for those who want to create routes between two points  from a vector network. The most obvious example of a network isthat of roads: the D42 road is both a single road and is made up of dozens of different sections.
    The sections are in the plugin the segments, and the road corresponds to a composition.
    All geographical work is done on the segments. The compositions only have attributes and a list containing the identifiers of the segments.
